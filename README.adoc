== Introduction


=== Learning objectives

* Run the Tribestream API Gateway (TAG) with Metrics
* How to use TAG Dashboards and Visualizations

=== Prerequisites

* link:https://www.docker.com/community-edition[Docker] installed and running
* link:https://curl.haxx.se/[Curl] installed

== Run Docker Image for ElasticSearch 5 and Kibana 5
To run the image with ElasticSearch and Kibana you need to increase the virtual memory:

For Linux: +
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

For OSX:

The vm_max_map_count setting must be set within the xhyve virtual machine.
```
screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty
```

Log in with root and no password. Then configure the sysctl setting as you would for Linux. +
```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
Exit by Control-A Control-\.

Run the docker image:
```
docker run -it -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5044:5044 sebp/elk:564
```
After a few seconds you should see the logs like this:

image::elk_kibana.png[title="Elastic Search  and Kibana logs"]

Test if ElasticSearch is properly running, thus in a web browser access http://localhost:9200. You will be able to see a page like this:

image::es_web.png[title="Elastic Search Web Page"]

You can access Kibana using the URL link:http://localhost:5601[].  This is the Kibana index configuration page. At this point Kibana is ready to receive the index configuration during TAG first startup so there is no need to configure anything from Kibana UI:

image::kibana_page.png[title="Kibana Web Page"]

== Run Tribestream API Gateway with Metrics Configuration
Go to the terminal, press _Ctrl P_ + _Ctrl Q_ and detach the previous docker image, then execute the command below to run TAG with Metrics configured pointing to the ElasticSearch and Kibana you started.

For Linux: +
```
docker run -it --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -e ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost -e KIBANA_HOST=localhost tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

For OSX: +
```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -e LICENSE=accept -e ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=host.docker.internal -e KIBANA_HOST=host.docker.internal tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
```

TAG is complete ready when you see the following message on the TAG log:

```
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8080"]
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-bio-8009"]
INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 18348 ms
```

After seeing this log message and the server is started you will be able to see Kibana running configured with the _tribe-metrics-*_ index.

URL: link:http://localhost:5601[]

== Scenario - Get an access token
The first scenario is to authenticate into TAG and get a token so you analyze that call using Kibana.

```
curl -XPOST -d "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin&client_id=admin&client_secret=admin" http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token
```

image::get_token.png[title="Access Token"]

== Discover Menu Kibana
Click on the _Discover_ tab so we are able analyze the incoming request. Note that there is a 15 minutes range in the top right that the filter for the events in a period of minutes. Thus, if your request disappear, you need to put a longer range. In the query input filter for _category:request_ and it will only show the requests.

image::discover.png[title="Discover Menu"]

The request we sent to get the token is there, now let’s expand and see what is in json sent by TAG. Click the arrow to expand, and then chose to visualize in _Table_ format or _JSON_. Inside the property __source_, is the payload sent by TAG. It has the content of a request, more specifically for this scenario data related to authentication as this is a request to get an access token. You will be able to find things that will be very helpful for analyzing the request like authentication result, the key used to sign the access token, the roles for that user and client, http headers and a lot of other things.

Let’s now raise the range to one hour so we don’t lose the data in the screen. To do that click Last 15 minutes, then click Last 1 Hour.

image::kibana_period.png[title="Kibana Period Configuration"]

Now let’s do one more call but with a wrong user so we have more data to analyze:

```
curl -XPOST -d "grant_type=password&username=wrong_user&password=admin&client_id=admin&client_secret=admin" http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token
```

You will see the message below:

image::wrong_user.png[title="Wrong user authentication"]


After that go to in the left menu click _Dashboard_ and then _OAuth2 Dashboard_.

image::dashboard.png[title="Dashboard Menu"]

== OAuth2 Dashboard Introduction
The OAuth2 Dashboard has all the authentication information related to OAuth2. Therefore here we have in the Requests visualization the two requests you did and with the date and their request ids. It can be used for filtering the the Discover menu if you want to see the full payload.

image::top_oauth2.png[title="OAuth2 Dashboard"]

The visualizations are mostly clickable so, for example, you can click in the Http Status 200 and it will filter the entire Dashboard. Also to checking in the arrow in the top right of each visualization will show you the legends. A lot of useful information are also in the pie charts, like Client ID, Users, Datacenter, Client IP, Server IP and so on.

The _Authentication by grant_ visualization will show you how many requests were done per grant type over the time. The next image shows we did two over a period of time and the right side visualization shows 1 access token grant was issued.

image::auth_by_grant.png[title="Authentication by grant"]

The _OAuth2 Response Time Breakdown by Grant_ will show you how long each part of the grant took to execute in second. So this will help to identify where the slowness is if there is one. The response time may be affected by an external system that TAG uses, like LDAP, or an external API claim source  for example.

image::oauth2_breakdown.png[title="OAuth2 Response Time Breakdown by Grant"]

The __Request by Error_ will tell you the reason a request failed, as we used username wrong_user, and got a 400 Bad Request the user_not_found error code is explicitly showing the issue with the request.

image::request_by_error.png[title="Request by Error"]

The _Authentication Response Time_ will tell you the average time in seconds the authentication took to execute.

image::auth_response_time.png[title="Authentication Response Time"]

And the last three ones in the OAuth2 Dashboard are:

_Traffic by User_ - It will show you the requests by User over a period of time.

_Authenticated User Count Over Time_ - It will show the Unique Users authenticated over a period of time.

_Request by Http Status_ - It will show you the number of requests over a period of time.

== Scenario - Call TAG with access token and proxy request to google

The purpose of this tutorial is not to go into details in TAG functionality but show the Metrics feature, therefore this is the reason we are going to add the route through the rest api.

To add the route to TAG, execute the curl command below:

```
curl -v 'http://localhost:8080/tag/api/route' -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' --data-binary '{"headers":[],"profileRequiresAll":true,"roles":[],"profiles":[{"id":"oauth2-profile","name":"OAuth2 Profile","displayName":"OAuth2 Profile","description":"The OAuth 2.0 Profile provides a way to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.\n\nThe TAG OAuth 2.0 implementation, uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as the tokens issued and used to authenticate to access endpoints.\n\nJWT tokens consist of a header and a set of claims, which are both Base64 encoded, and a signature calculated using RSA\nwith SHA256. Overall, this creates three Base64 strings which are concatenated together with dots (.). Each use of a\nJWT token within TAG is validated using the TAG RSA public key, preventing tokens issued by the TAG from being tampered\nwith.\n"}],"index":1,"modRewrite":"RewriteRule \"^/google$\" \"http://www.google.com\" [P,NE,auth]","lastMatchPattern":"^/google$","roleRequiresAll":true,"tags":[],"name":"Google","id":"google"}' --compressed
```

Now you will have a route you can call on link:http://localhost:8080/google[], when you call it with proper OAuth2 authentication it will proxy you to google.

To call the Google Route execute the command below, replacing <access-token> with the value you got in the “Get Access Token” scenario:
```
curl -v -XGET -H "Authorization:Bearer <access-token>" http://localhost:8080/google
```

PS: If the access token has already expired, you need to authenticate again.

Now that you were able to use the proxy feature, you will learn how to analyze it with Metrics.  Go back to the Dashboard page and click Proxy Dashboard.

== Proxy Dashboard Introduction

In the _Proxy Dashboard_ you will be able to see the request you just did. Then you will be able to analyze the requests in several visualizations.

_Request Path_ - will show you how many requests were sent to a path.
_Requests_ - will show you the date and request id.
_Keys_ - will show you the key information, thus this request had a token signed with oauth2-keypair using RS256 as the algorithm. The expiration date is n/d as oauth2 keys do not expire in TAG.
_Routes_ - will show you where the request was routed to, method, average total response time, and average response time which measures how long google took to respond.

image::top_proxy_dashboard.png[title="Tables with Routes"]

After the top tables you will see the pie charts, that have very useful data for filtering just like we mentioned in the OAuth2 Dashboard.

image::proxy_pie.png[title="Proxy Pie Charts"]

Let’s now call the route 10 times and then check the next visualization.

```
for i in {1..10}; do curl -v -XGET -H "Authorization:Bearer <access-token>" http://localhost:8080/google; done;
```

The _Proxy Dashboard_ also provides a way to analyze percentiles. The visualization _Route Response Time_, will help you to analyze if in an ordered sample a small number of users may be having lower performance than others. 95th or 99th for example may provide spikes if only few users are having bad performance in a period of time. Also in the right side there is the _Route Average Response Time_.

image::route_response_time.png[title="Route Response Time"]

The _Response Time by Route_, will help you to compare response times between routes, which may help you to identify low performance routes and take an action.

The _Traffic by Route_, will tell you how many requests were sent to each route, which may help you to identify the most active microservices you have.

image::by_route.png[title="Response Time and Traffic by Route"]

The _Request by Error_ is the same as the one we checked in the _OAuth2 Dashboard_, but now in a different scenario where we called /google with an expired access token, therefore the visualization will show the issue explicitly.

image::request_by_error_proxy.png[title="Request By Error Proxy"]

The _Traffic by User_ will how you how many requests a user is doing in a period of time. It may help you to spot attacks or even credentials being shared in case the number is too high for a specific user.

image::traffic_by_user2.png[title="Traffic by User Proxy"]

The last one in the list is _Average Response Time by server and by datacenter_, which will show you exactly what the name says.

image::responsetime_by_server_datacenter.png[title="Response Time by Server and Datacenter"]

== Stop Docker Images
After executing this tutorial stop all docker images so it does not overload your computer.
```
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```
